Welcome to my Github repository for the machine learning course at National University of Colombia! Here you will find all of my notes, exercises, and related materials that I have accumulated throughout the course. As I progress through the course, I will be updating this repository with new content, so be sure to check back often. This repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about machine learning or who is taking this course. Feel free to use the materials here for your own studies, and don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or comments. Thanks for visiting!
